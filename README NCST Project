_________________________________________________________________

TO DO:
- GF86 K2: 187, 222, 263, 040, 034, 160, 258, and 158 - check these for relatedness squew
   ANSWER!!!! all these are missing the CXX.402 allele, none of the others are, drop this allele,   
   reanalyze based on this
- GenAlEx
  - Try Spatial
  - Mantel
  - PCoA
- 
- Check 001, 012 date and location, 

- Maps. 
    - trying different cex values for k1.geno and k2.geno for plotting, 3 ok, trying 0.5 step       
      increases
    - add traffic rates to 49
    - culverts???
    - see if K2 for GFOX is spatial or something else
    - in genotyped column, designate K1, K2, Species (remove intial plot of points, only Specified points)
    - See about constructing a way to designate repeated individuals, different symbols?
    
Notes on error bars

### Error Bars

First, see page 61 of the ggplot2 book.

For geoms that display an error, you need a column in your dataframe that explicitly contains the standard error, and then you're going to add/subtract that SE from each y value by using the `ymin` and `ymax` arguments within the `aesthetic()` call:

```{r errorbars}

y <- c(18, 11, 16)
df <- data.frame(animals = c("cats", "dogs", "orangutans"), y = y, se = c(1.2, 0.5, 1.0))
df

base <- ggplot(df, aes(x = animals, y = y))
base
base <- base + geom_bar(stat = "identity", aes(fill = animals)) + ylim(c(0, 20))
base
base + geom_crossbar(aes(ymin = y - se, ymax = y + se))

base + geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = y - se, ymax = y + se, width = 0.5))

base + geom_pointrange(aes(ymin = y - se, ymax = y + se))


base + geom_smooth(stat = "identity")

base + geom_bar(stat = "identity") + geom_errorbar(aes(ymin= y-se, ymax= y+se, width = 0.5))

base + geom_linerange(aes(ymin = y - se, ymax = y + se))

base + geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = y - se, ymax = y + se), alpha = 0.5)


------------------------------------ DATA SETUP -----------------------------------------

1) Use cty b to determine source species

2) For Gray Fox, use Plex 1 and 2. Coyotes use RFscat Plex 3 and 4

3) Score microsats using STRand

4) Build consensus genotypes for successful samples

------------------------------------ STRUCTURE SETUP ------------------------------------

5) Feed consensus genotypes for > 85% complete loci into Allelematch script
  - use to determine the number of unique individuals based on the recommended allele mismatch

6) Remove sex marker genotype, input text file into STRUCTURE
  - Make sure the individual column has no header
  - If locational coordinates are on the sheet, make sure to note in setup
  - In Parameters select Infer lambda and Infer alpha
  - Burnin 10,000, run 100,000, ten iterations per K for test run
  - Burnin 10,000, run 100,000, ______________ for figure
  
7) Take resulting Results folder, zip and import into Structure Harvester
  - use to determine most likely K value
  - Download Clumpp indfile for most likely K

8) CLUMPP to create figure file for use in ggplot to make a more controled graphic
  - should be able to use distruct to create intial files to feed into CLUMPP, but not working on this computer, must do manually
   - save indfile to a text file, copy into example indfile, save as "Name of Structure Run".indfile

  a) Creating INDQ file from indfile: 
    - open param file for CLUMPP in notepad 
    - edit names of files accordingly and set to correct number of individuals, populations, etc.
    - Run CLUMMP in same folder as indfile and param file (will not work otherwise)

  b) Creating POPQ file:  (need to see if this is needed for the stacked plot)
    - 

9) Create plot using STRUCTURE Stacked Plot Script
 - edit individuals based on spatial location, or Pop assignment

------------------------------------ MAPPING FIGURE --------------------------------------

10) Plotting sample locations on map
  - readin data, designate by genotype
  - read in road, must be a shx file, shp alone does not work
  - would be good to see if I can specify a specific highway, not all


----------------------------------- POP GEN ANALYSIS ------------------------------------GenAlEx (excel based) allows:
 - Frequency Based Statistic Procedures

There are several routines that can be optionally included in the
analysis and there are multiple output options including a PDF with
the report, R-code and an object (fname.results) containing all of
the results, which can be used for further analyses.

------------------------------ Frequency Based Statitistcis -----------------------------

1) Creating a genid object
   - copied project data file from structure run, add .stru suffix 
   - cannot have . in marker names, means replace with _
   - set NA value to -99
   - DO NOT label population column, creates an error

2) allele.rich requires there to be a population column in the genid object
